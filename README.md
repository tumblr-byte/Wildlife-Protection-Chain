# üêÖüêòü¶è Wildlife-Protection-Chain  

## Overview  
**Wildlife-Protection-Chain** is an **AI + Blockchain powered project** designed to protect endangered animals like **tigers, rhinos, and elephants**.  

Using **sample images and videos (Pixabay/Pexels)**, the system can:  
- Detect animals (Tiger, Elephant, Rhino)  
- Identify their condition (Normal / Injured)  
- Recognize environmental threats (Person, Vehicle, Plastic, Fire, Weapon)  

Unlike traditional alert-only systems, Wildlife-Protection-Chain logs every animal detection event on the blockchain including species, condition, environment, time, and location creating a **tamper-proof record of wildlife observations**.

## What the App Does  
1. **Upload Image or Video** ‚Äì User uploads a wildlife photo or clip.  
2. **Processing & Detection** ‚Äì The system analyzes animals, their condition, and surrounding environment.  
3. **DeepSORT Tracking** ‚Äì Animals are tracked across frames for more reliable monitoring.  
4. **Top 5 Key Frames (for videos)** ‚Äì Extracted to let users visually confirm detections and validate AI predictions.  
5. **Blockchain Logging** ‚Äì Each detection event is stored with:  
   - Timestamp  
   - Randomized Location (for demo)  
   - Species (Elephant, Tiger, Rhino)  
   - Condition (Normal / Injured)  
   - Threat type(s), if found  
6. **Outputs** ‚Äì Users can download:  
   - CSV report with all detection events  
   - Annotated video showing detected animals and threats  

---

## Why It Matters  
- **Endangered Wildlife Protection** ‚Äì Elephants, rhinos, and tigers face constant threats from poaching, habitat loss, and human interference.  
- **Transparency & Trust** ‚Äì Blockchain ensures every record is immutable and cannot be tampered with.  
- **Human-in-the-loop Validation** ‚Äì Key frame extraction allows people to verify AI outputs instead of relying blindly on automation.  
- **Sustainability Focused** ‚Äì Scales into conservation tech for long-term environmental monitoring.

## Measurable Impact  
- 100% of detections logged on blockchain for transparency.  
- Top-5 frame validation ensures trust in AI predictions.  
- Automated detection of threats (fire, plastic, vehicles, poachers).  
- DeepSORT-based tracking improves consistency across video frames.  
- Proof of concept with Pixabay/Pexels datasets.  
- Scalable design for drones, ranger cameras, and IoT sensors.  

**Note:** For best results, upload **high-quality images or videos with good lighting**. Low-resolution or poorly lit media may affect detection accuracy.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend / UI:** Streamlit  
- **AI/ML:** Computer Vision (YOLO / Custom Image Classification Model + DeepSORT for tracking)  
- **Blockchain:** Custom lightweight blockchain implementation for storing detection events (species, condition, threats, timestamp, location) in a tamper-proof manner  
- **Media Sources:** Pixabay & Pexels (images/videos used for demonstration)  

---

## Future Scope  
- Drone integration for live monitoring of protected zones.  
- Expansion to detect more species beyond elephants, tigers, and rhinos.  
- Advanced condition classification: Normal / Injured / Entangled (stuck in nets, ropes, or sharp objects).  
- Enhanced environmental threat detection by training on additional harmful objects (weapons, traps, etc.).  
- Behavior-based monitoring: if an animal is detected lying down for too long, trigger an immediate rescue alert.  
- GPS-based tracking for precise location logging and intervention.  
- Decentralized data sharing with NGOs, governments, and researchers.  
- Mobile app for rangers to receive real-time blockchain-verified alerts.

## Example Output (CSV Log)  
| Timestamp           | Location   | Species  | Condition | Threats          |  
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------------|  
| 2025-09-23 14:22:11 | X1-Y9-Z3  | Elephant | Injured   | Plastic, Person  |  
| 2025-09-23 14:23:04 | A4-B2-C6  | Tiger    | Normal    | None             |  
| 2025-09-23 14:25:19 | D3-E7-F1  | Rhino    | Normal    | Vehicle, Fire    |  

---

## Limitations  
- Occasional false detections may occur due to limited demo dataset and variable image quality.  
- Tracking (DeepSORT) works but is not perfect in all cases (e.g., occlusions, low light).  
- Current implementation is a proof of concept using sample media, not real-time field data.
